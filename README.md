## Course logistics

This course **does not use** Canvas. Canvas is a convoluted system with too many features and undefined purpose. Instead, this course is served from [GitHub](https://github.com/nekrut/BMMB582). 

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do not contact me through Canvas!** I will not check my Inbox there. Instead, contact me via [email](mailto:aun1@psu.edu?Subject=BMMB582) as described above.
