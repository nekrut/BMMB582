# A quick overview of sequencing technologies


## Illumina

{Illumina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2581791/pdf/nihms72488.pdf) (originally Solexa) is the second highly parallel sequencing technology. 
It is by far the most widely used technology of the day:

### Pros

- Reads up to 300 bp in single or paired end configuration
- Straightforward multiplexing
- Relatively low error rate
- Very high throughput

### Cons

- Reads up to 300 bp
- Relatively high cost per base for smaller machines

### How does it work
